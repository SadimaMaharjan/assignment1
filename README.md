# Week 1 Challenge

## Refactoring Existing Code

- The existing code has been improved to make it more accessible. The semantic HTML elements have been added, alt attributes are added to the images and the page follows a logical structure. The CSS has also been modified with comments.

## User Story

- AS A marketing agency
  I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
  SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  - WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  - WHEN I view the icon and image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  - WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
  - WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
